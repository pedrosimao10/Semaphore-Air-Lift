# Semaphore-Air-Lift
2nd Project of Sistemas Operativos - Air Lift Simulation using Semaphores

## Objective
Understanding the mechanisms associated with the execution and synchronization of processes and threads.

## Concept
Develop a C application that simulates the air lift. Passengers, hostess and pilot will be independent processes, and their synchronization is performed through semaphores and memory shared. Passengers are assumed to take some time to arrive at the airport and that this arrival time can be determined through a distribution of uniform probability with maximum time. Processes should be active only when it is necessary, and should block whenever they have to wait for an event.
